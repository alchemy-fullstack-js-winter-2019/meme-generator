# Meme Generator

**Author**: [Cari Palazzolo](https://github.com/caripizza)

## Overview
In this lab, I created a custom font app and WYSIWYG editor that allows users to create fonts and memes and download them locally.

## Technologies Used
React, Node.js, Figlet, Webpack, PostCSS, HTML
* js uses babel-loader with the @babel/preset-env and @babel/preset-react
* css uses style-loader, css-loader, and postcss-loader with the autoprefixer and postcss-nested plugins
* images uses url-loader

## Getting Started
1. Clone and download [GitHub repo](https://github.com/caripizza/meme-generator)
1. Install dependencies:\
`npm i`

3. Run scripts:\
`npm run lint`\
`npm run pretest`\
`npm run start` (start localhost)\
`npm run build` (build for production)
