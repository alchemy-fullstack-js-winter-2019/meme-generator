# React Meme Generator
## February 19, 2019

This is a React app that allows users to create and save their own memes! Users upload an image via a url link, and then enter in the text they want to appear in the header and/or footer of their photo to create their meme. Once the meme is completed to their satisfaction, users are able to click the save button and download their newly created meme as a png image to their computer!
