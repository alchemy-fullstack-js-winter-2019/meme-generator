Pure component only rerenders when the propeties change
Component- when the parent changes

event.peventDefault would prevent page from refreshing if it was a submit. 

state = anything that is changeable including by the user. 

functional components are a way to differentiate from components that take states. 

FormatDisplay.js is just referencing the dom. 

The reason we break functions up into components is so they can be used throughout files/injected throughout files. 

User.findByid: static
user.create: instance
/in React we used a stattic proptypes 

pure components change when the props that get passed to it get chnages. 

//problem
 handleChange = ({ target }) => {
   this.setState({ [target.name]: target.value }), () => {
     console.log(target.value);
   };
 };

//good
 handleChange = ({ target }) => {
   this.setState({ [target.name]: target.value }, () => {
     console.log(target.value);
   });
 };
